Introduction
======
Climate has been a global topic for the past decades and one of the eminent existential threats for modern civilisation due to climate change. The industrial revolution has been one of the primary catalyst to increase the global carbon footprint, greenhouse emission, halogens such as chlorofluorocarbon amongst other non-anthropomorphic climate forcings. These activities has steadily led to wide spread changes in climatic conditions such as global temperature, sea levels, precipitation, and other indicators. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [1] (the United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change),it certain that, in most places temperature will continue to rise. Therefore, the rise of global temperature will have cascading and feedback effect on other processes that contribute to climatic conditions.

In light of this, it is vital to understand the climate patterns of different regions especially in sub-Saharan Africa, primarily to have more specific, detailed and valid information to inform policy and help in preparedness of extreme events. Africa, has an equatorial climate, tropical wet and dry climate, monsoon climate, semi-arid climate, desert climate and the subtropical highland climate. Due to this, different regions vary in the amount of precipitation and the temperatures. East Africa is in the eastern part of Africa. It mainly experiences a tropical climate due to the equator. The region has low altitude areas and high altitude areas which makes the weather patterns vary. This study focuses on the climatology of East Africa with a focus on the precipitation and temperature, mean and their seasonality as well as the dryness and wetness conditions in the region. The figure [1] below shows the map of the East Africa region, the principal geographic area of study with a special interest in Kenya.

Kenya is a country in East Africa that lies along the equator. It has 7 climate regions in the different geographical regions such as high altitude areas as well as the low altitude areas. Due to this, the temperature varies from cool to hot depending on the altitude of the area. The physical geography also greatly affects the rainfall patterns and the amount of rainfall received. The high altitude areas such as the central part of the country receives high rainfall. The coastal area, which is a low altitude, experiences hot and wet climate conditions. The northern part which is the Semi-arid, is adversely affected by dry conditions and very high temperatures.


Data and Methodology
======
Data In this report, we utilised two archive dataset (chirts_Africa_masked.nc and chirps-v2.0.1985-2004.days_p25.nc ) from the Climate Hazards Group, the University of California at Santa Barbara [2]. The gridded convective precipitation (measured in mm/day) ranges from 1985-01-01 to 2004-12-31 at a daily interval with 7305 timesteps. The Climate Hazards Center Temperature Maximum (Tmax measured in degree Celcius) range from 1983-01-01 to 2016-12-31 at daily intervals with 12444 timesteps. Both climatological datasets follow the NetCDF Climate and Forecast (CF) 1.6 metadata conventions.

Methodology To help understand the underlying climatology including seasonal conditions (i.e., mean precipitation, Tmax, wetness and dryness) over eastern Africa with a focus on Kenya, we have used Climate Data Operator (CDO), which is a collection of command-line Operators to manipulate and analyse Climate and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model data [3] and Python programming Language with its helper libraries for visualisation. We computed the mean precipitation and maximum temperature at both regional and country levels to help provide fine-grain climatic processes over the time frames in both datasets.

Results and Discussion

*Mean climatology*

The figures below show the mean temperature experienced in East Africa as well as temperature in the four different seasons.
