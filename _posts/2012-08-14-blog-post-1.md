Introduction
======
Climate has been a global topic for the past decades and one of the eminent existential threats for modern civilisation due to climate change. The industrial revolution has been one of the primary catalyst to increase the global carbon footprint, greenhouse emission, halogens such as chlorofluorocarbon amongst other non-anthropomorphic climate forcings. These activities has steadily led to wide spread changes in climatic conditions such as global temperature, sea levels, precipitation, and other indicators. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [1] (the United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change),it certain that, in most places temperature will continue to rise. Therefore, the rise of global temperature will have cascading and feedback effect on other processes that contribute to climatic conditions.
